# Least Squares Approximation
## Purpose
Implement an algorithm for calculating the least squares approximation (Linear and Polynomial).
## Input File Format
The program gets information about the points through a text file (input.txt).
The first line contains the degree of polynomial and number of points.
The following two lines have the x and y of the points.
